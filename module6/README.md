# SISCER 2020 Docker Container

## Description

This repo contains all code used to create the Docker image that was used 
to run the lab code during [Module 1 of UW SISCER 2020](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/siscer2020/modules/CR2001).

## Usage

This GitHub repository contains the source code needed to build the
docker image that was used in class. The built image is also available on
[DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/dbenkeser/repository/docker/dbenkeser/siscer2020).
The code for the labs can be found in the `/R` directory.

When the docker image is built, a number of `R` packages are installed and 
user accounts are made for all individuals in `roster.csv` using `make_users.sh`.
The `roster.csv` is expected to have two columns, where the first column is the 
participant's last name, the second column is the first name. The script creates
users of the form `[first letter of first name][last name]`. For confidentiality, 
I've replace the true course roster with fake names (that result in users: `auser`,
`buser`, `cuser`, `duser`, and `euser`). 

To run the docker image on a local machine (i.e., to obtain the same R Studio
environment that was demonstrated in class), you need to [download docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) to your local machine. 

From the command line you would execute the following command.

``` bash
docker run -e PASSWORD=sosecret! -p 8787:8787 -d dbenkeser/siscer:latest
```

Here the `-e` option is required to run the `rocker/rstudio` image that 
our Docker image is built on. The `-d` option runs in detached mode, which makes 
the container run in the background. The `-p` option opens port 87, so you 
can access the RStudio GUI, by opening a browser window and navigating to 
`localhost:8787`, where you will be 
prompted to login to R Studio. You can use the default user (`rstudio`) and the 
`PASSWORD` created above or using the credentials we made based on `roster.csv`. 

The container can also be run through a cloud service (e.g., an [AWS EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?hp=tile&so-exp=below), or a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet). Almost all services have machine 
images that include docker. All you have to do is `ssh` into the cloud server and
execute the same command as above. Then users can log in via `http://ipaddress:8787`
where `ipaddress` is the ip address of the cloud server. 

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or can't remember how to run the container you can
